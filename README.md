# QuantMeta
QuantMeta uses the results of sequencing metagenomes spiked with known concentrations of standards to determine the absolute abundance of target genes, genomes, or contigs within metagenomes. The pipeline provides a method for applying rigorous quantitative limitations to potential targets to improve the detection confidence and quantification accuracy.
